								<h2>Caitlin Kantor</h2>
								<p>Junior Caitlin Kantor lives in San Francisco, CA. Activities outside of school have included:  Internships with Girls Who Code at Square &amp; with RedShift Design, Mission Bit, Columbia University Girls in STEM, and Teaching children in: sports, STEM, and special needs. All of these experiences, living and working with people of different cultural backgrounds, of different demographics and abilities gave her a strong appreciation for different ideas, perspectives and values and the ability to trust and collaborate across such differences.
								She would like to pursue computer and/or mechanical/electrical engineering.</p>
								<h2><a href="https://kaitlynchan.github.io/"> Kaitlyn Chan</a></h2>
								<p>At first glance, Kaitlyn, a junior from Mills High School, may seem like her head is in the clouds. However, it is more likely that she is pondering whether to design the newspaper layout, plan her STEM club meeting, figure out a schematic for robotics, blog about the latest hackathon she attended, create curriculum for the Girls Who Code club, or eat a snack. She hopes her future includes <code>haptic robotics</code> and/or studying pandas. </p>
								<h2>Sethmi Kachchakaduge</h2>
								<p>Sethmi is a senior at San Mateo High School who has had a passion for STEM at a young age and is dedicated to exposing more young women to the art of computer science. She currently facilitates a Girls Who Code club in her city and is part of Vulcan Robotics, a student run, world-ranked robotics team in San Mateo, CA. </p>
								<h2>Sona Dolasia</h2>
								<p>Sona’s propensity for STEM began at a young age, but it wasn’t until middle school that she discovered her passion for computer science. The Tamalpais High School senior is involved with several organizations. In high school, Sona founded <a href="http://reachingoutwithrobotics.com/">Reaching Out With Robotics</a>, a mentorship program that connects kids with teens over robotics. Sona also serves and the president of both the Computer Science Club and Robotics Club at Tam. Over the past couple years, she has participated in internships for the UC Berkeley AUTOLab, DOGOmedia, and Chute Inc. Sona has also been recognized by a National Center for Women and Information Technology for her accomplishments in coding as a 2017 National Winner of the Award for Aspirations in Computing. Sona plans to pursue her passion for math and science in college. </p>
								<h2>Girls Teaching Girls To Code</h2>
								<p>Girls Teaching Girls to Code is a program where Stanford women in Computer Science teach Bay Area high school girls to code.</p>
